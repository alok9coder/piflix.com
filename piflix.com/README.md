This is an experimental repository. 
I will add this in my Portfolio projects. 
The Copyright symbol mentioned at the end is just for Aesthetic purpose, I do not have the copyright for the domain.

This project is ment to run on a rasperry pi or any x86-32bit old pc with raspbian or similar OS installed. 
The project will need NodeJS to run on the backend-server. 
It Streams Movies though it's web portal in the Private Network. 
It can do the same at Public Network but that will require you to port-forward your router and get a public IPv4 address. 
The project isn't complete it required some additions and some changes to me made.
